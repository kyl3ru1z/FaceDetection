# FaceDetection
Uses OpenCV and pre-trained Haar Casacdes to detect faces. I've also added the eye and cat Haar Cascade for fun. In the program whenever a face, cat, or eye is detected a box will appear with text on the top left corner to signal to the user that a detection has been succesful.

# What I Learned 
- How Harr Cascades are trained 
- Functionality of Haar Cascades (Scale factor & Neighbors)
- Utilizing OpenCV to put rectangles and text on to the screen
